							The impact of life&apos;s challenges on your mental and emotional well-being cannot be underestimated. Loneliness, depression,
							anxiety, and grief can affect any one of us. A current life crisis or recurrent life problems of whatever magnitude can lead to
							symptoms and poor life choices that interfere with everyday functioning and can undermine your ability to work, play, and share your
							life with others. Each of us has the capacity to not merely cope with life&apos;s struggles but to experience a profound sense of
							accomplishment at discovering inner resilience and strength. Psychotherapy offers the opportunity to find new and more adaptive
							solutions and can help enhance a sense of mastery over your inner and external life.
